               <p>A truly world-class casino resort comes to Manila! Tiger Resort Leisure & Entertainment, Inc. (TRLEI) brings the newest, grandest, and most exciting gaming and entertainment destination in Asia. The casino and resort is an iconic landmark that features a unique and remarkable Dome nightclub and an exclusive beach club, unrivaled not only in Manila but in the whole of Asia. The most breathtaking spectacle within the property is the dancing water display and light show – an impressive extravaganza—that’s even more incredible than the world-renowned fountains of Dubai. The property also provides guests with the largest and most luxurious gaming floors in the Philippines. Aside from the excitement and thrills of gaming, guests can take a break and splurge on the most–sought-after luxury and international brands in the shopping esplanade or relax in one of the casino and resort’s well-designed and stunning selection of deluxe rooms, villas, and suites. They can also indulge in a fancy and tasty snack or a lavish gourmet spread from Manila’s finest casual and signature dining restaurants. With the beautiful Manila Bay as its stunning backdrop, the casino and resort complex is also designing an exclusive marina to allow guests to arrive in style aboard yachts. They can land right outside the property and enjoy the incredible amenities just steps away. This website gives our guests a glimpse of our iconic resort and showcases the progress of our vision to provide a world-class entertainment property and to make the Philippines the biggest travel destination in Asia.
